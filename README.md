# Ship Window

Adds a glass window to the drop ship so you can see outside. The Company didn't see it as important, so they put the terminal computer in front of it. Be sure to move that!

All players must install this mod or there may be desync issues.
Check mod configuration after first launch for controlling skybox, window shutter, and outside space prop behaviors.
